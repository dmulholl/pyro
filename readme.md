# Pyro

Pyro is a dynamically-typed, garbage-collected scripting language implemented in C. (This is an experimental project I'm working on for my own edutainment - it's at an early stage and isn't suitable yet for any kind of real world use.)

To build the binary:

    $ make release

To run the test suite:

    $ pyro test tests/*.pyro
