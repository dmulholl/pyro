# Pyro

[1]: http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/pyro/master/

Pyro is a dynamically-typed, garbage-collected scripting language implemented in C. This means that it lives in roughly the same neighbourhood in programming language space as languages like Python or Ruby.

```ruby
def fib(n) {
    if n < 2 {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

Pyro is a classic braces-and-semicolons language. If you've used any C-family language before you should find it instantly intuitive.

See the [documentation][1] for details.
