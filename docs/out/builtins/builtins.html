### Strings

A string, `str`, is an immutable array of bytes.

[[ `$str(arg: any) -> str` ]]

    Stringifies the argument, i.e. returns its default string representation.
    If the argument has a `:$str()` method, the output of this method will be returned.

Pyro strings have methods that let you manipulate them as ASCII or as UTF-8 but the string type itself is agnostic about its encoding --- a string can contain any sequence of byte values including null bytes or invalid UTF-8.

String literals come in two flavours --- regular and raw. Both can contain arbitrary byte sequences, including literal newlines.

Regular string literals use double quotes:

::: code pyro
    var foo = "a string";

    var bar = "a string
    with multiple
    lines";

Regular string literals process all the usual backslashed escapes:

::: table
    `\\\\` | backslash
    `\\0` | null byte
    `\\"` | double quote
    `\\'` | single quote
    `\\b` | backspace
    `\\e` | escape
    `\\f` | form feed
    `\\n` | newline
    `\\r` | carriage return
    `\\t` | tab
    `\\v` | vertical tab
    `\\x##` | 8-bit hex-encoded byte value
    `\\u####` | 16-bit hex-encoded unicode code point (output as UTF-8)
    `\\U########` | 32-bit hex-encoded unicode code point (output as UTF-8)

Raw string literals use backticks:

::: code pyro
    var foo = `a raw string`;

    var bar = `a raw string
    with multiple
    lines`;

Raw string literals ignore backslashed escapes. The only character a raw string literal can't contain is a backtick as this would end the string.

You can concatenate two strings using the `+` operator:

::: code pyro
    assert "abc" + "def" == "abcdef";

You can multiply a string by an integer `n` to produce a new string containing `n` copies of the original:

::: code pyro
    assert "foo" * 3 == "foofoofoo"

Strings have the following methods:

[[ `:byte(index: i64) -> i64` ]]

    Returns the byte value at `index` as an integer in the range `[0, 255]`.
    Will panic if `index` isn't an integer or is out of range.
    Indices are zero-based.

[[ `:byte_count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of bytes in the string.

[[ `:bytes() -> iter[i64]` ]]

    Returns an iterator over the string's bytes as `i64` values.

[[ `:char(index: i64) -> char` ]]

    Returns the `char` at `index`, where `index` is a zero-based offset into the sequence of UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points in the string.
    Will panic if `index` isn't an integer or is out of range.

    (This is a potentially expensive method as it needs to seek forward from the beginning of the string.
    Note that it will panic if it encounters invalid UTF-8 along the way.)

[[ `:char_count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points in the string.

    (This is a potentially expensive method as it needs to traverse the string.
    Note that it will panic if it encounters invalid UTF-8.)

[[ `:chars() -> iter[char]` ]]

    Returns an iterator over the string's `char` values, i.e. UTF-8 encoded Unicode code points.

[[ `:contains(target: str) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string contains the substring `target`.

    (Note that every string contains the empty string `""` as the empty string is a valid substring of every string.)

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of bytes in the string.
    This method is an alias for `:byte_count()`.

[[ `:ends_with(suffix: str) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string ends with the string `suffix`, otherwise `false`.

[[ `:index_of(target: str, start_index: i64) -> i64|err` ]]

    Returns the byte index of the next matching instance of the string `target`.
    Starts searching at `start_index`.
    Returns an `err` if `target` is not found.

[[ `:is_ascii() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string is empty or contains only byte values in the range `[0, 127]`.
    (This is a potentially expensive method as it needs to traverse the string.)

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string is empty, i.e. if its length is zero.

[[ `:is_utf8() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string is empty or contains only valid UTF-8.
    (This is a potentially expensive method as it needs to traverse the string.)

[[ `:join(items: iterable) -> str` ]]

    Creates a new string by joining the stringified elements of the iterable argument using the receiver string as the separator. Elements are automatically stringified --- this is equivalent to calling `$str()` on each element.

[[ `:lines() -> iter[str]` ]]

    Returns an iterator over the string's lines.
    Recognised line breaks are `\r\n`, `\r`, and `\n`.
    Strips the line breaks from the returned strings.

[[ `:match(target: str, index: i64) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string `target` matches at byte index `index`.

[[ `:replace(old: str, new: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string with all instances of the string `old` replaced by the string `new`.

[[ `:slice(start_index: i64) -> str` <br> `:slice(start_index: i64, length: i64) -> str` ]]

    Copies a slice of the source string and returns it as a new string.
    The source string is left unchanged.
    The slice starts at byte index `start_index` and contains `length` bytes.

    If `start_index` is negative, counts backwards from the end of the string --- i.e. a `start_index` of `-1` refers to to the last byte in the string.

    If `length` is omitted, copies to the end of the source string.

    Panics if either argument is out of range.

[[ `:split(sep: str) -> vec[str]` ]]

    Splits the string on instances of the delimiter string `sep`.
    Returns a vector of strings.

[[ `:split_lines() -> vec[str]` ]]

    Splits the string into lines.
    Recognised line breaks are `\r\n`, `\r`, and `\n`.
    Strips the line breaks from the returned strings.
    Returns a vector of strings.

[[ `:split_on_ascii_ws() -> vec[str]` ]]

    This method splits the string on contiguous sequences of ASCII whitespace characters.
    Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored.
    Returns a vector of strings.

[[ `:starts_with(prefix: str) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the string starts with the string `prefix`, otherwise `false`.

[[ `:strip() -> str` <br> `:strip(bytes: str) -> str` ]]

    When called with no arguments, this method returns the new string formed by stripping leading and trailing ASCII whitespace characters from the string.
    (In this case it functions as an alias for `:strip_ascii_ws()`.)

    When called with a single string argument, this method returns the new string formed by stripping any leading or trailing bytes that occur in `bytes`.
    (In this case it functions as an alias for `:strip_bytes()`.)

[[ `:strip_ascii_ws() -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping leading and trailing ASCII whitespace characters.

[[ `:strip_bytes(bytes: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any leading or trailing bytes that occur in `bytes`.

[[ `:strip_chars(chars: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any leading or trailing UTF-8 encoded codepoints that occur in `chars`.

[[ `:strip_prefix(prefix: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string with the leading string `prefix` stripped if present.
    (Only a single instance of `prefix` will be stripped.)

[[ `:strip_prefix_bytes(bytes: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any leading bytes that occur in `bytes`.

[[ `:strip_prefix_chars(chars: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any leading UTF-8 encoded codepoints that occur in `chars`.

[[ `:strip_suffix(suffix: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string with the trailing string `suffix` stripped if present.
    (Only a single instance of `suffix` will be stripped.)

[[ `:strip_suffix_bytes(bytes: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any trailing bytes that occur in `bytes`.

[[ `:strip_suffix_chars(chars: str) -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping any trailing UTF-8 encoded codepoints that occur in `chars`.

[[ `:strip_utf8_ws() -> str` ]]

    Returns the new string formed by stripping leading and trailing UTF-8 encoded whitespace characters, as defined by the Unicode standard.

[[ `:to_ascii_lower() -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string with all ASCII uppercase characters converted to lowercase.

[[ `:to_ascii_upper() -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string with all ASCII lowercase characters converted to uppercase.

[[ `:to_hex() -> str` ]]

    Returns a new string containing the hex-escaped byte values from the orginal string ---
    e.g. `\`foo\`` becomes `\`\x66\x6F\x6F\``.
    Useful for inspecting and debugging Unicode.



### Characters

A character, `char`, is an unsigned 32-bit integer representing a Unicode code point.


[[ `$char(arg: i64) -> char` ]]

    Converts `arg` to a `char`.
    Panics if the argument is out of range.

Character literals use single quotes:

::: code pyro
    var c1 = 'a';
    var c2 = 'â‚¬';
    var c3 = 'ðŸ”¥';

A character literal should contain either a single UTF-8 encoded code point or a backslashed escape sequence representing a code point.

::: code pyro
    assert '\x61' == 'a';
    assert '\u20AC' == 'â‚¬';

Character literals support all the same backslashed escape sequences as strings.

You can convert a character to a string using the `$str()` function  --- this returns a string containing the UTF-8 encoded representation of the codepoint:

::: code pyro
    assert $str('a') == "a";
    assert $str('ðŸ”¥') == "ðŸ”¥";

You can convert a character to an integer using the `$i64()` function or an integer to a character using the `$char()` function:

::: code pyro
    assert $i64('a') == 97;
    assert $char(97) == 'a';

If you add two characters together using the `+` operator, the result will be a UTF-8 encoded string:

::: code pyro
    assert 'x' + 'y' == "xy";

Similarly, you can prepend or append a character to a string using the `+` operator:

::: code pyro
    assert 'x' + "yz" == "xyz";
    assert "xy" + 'z' == "xyz";

You can multiply a character by an integer `n` to produce a string with `n` UTF-8 encoded copies of the character:

::: code pyro
    assert 'x' * 3 == "xxx";
    assert 'ðŸ”¥' * 3 == "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥";



### Vectors

A vector, `vec`, is a dynamic array of values.

[[ `$vec() -> vec` <br> `$vec(arg: iterable) -> vec` <br> `$vec(size: i64, fill_value: any) -> vec` ]]

    Creates a new `vec` object.

    * If called with zero arguments, creates an empty vector.
    * If called with a single iterable argument, fills the new vector by iterating over the argument.
    * If called with two arguments, creates a vector with the specified initial size and fill value.

Alternatively, you can create a vector using literal syntax:

::: code pyro
    var vec = ["foo", "bar", "baz"];

You can index into a vector to get or set entries:

::: code pyro
    var value = vec[index];
    var value = vec:get(index);

    vec[index] = value;
    vec:set(index, value);

Indices are zero-based. Indexing is equivalent to using the `:get()` and `:set()` methods as shown.

Vectors are iterable:

::: code pyro
    for item in [123, 456, 789] {
        echo item;
    }

Vectors have the following methods:

[[ `:append(value: any)` ]]

    Appends a value to the vector.

[[ `:contains(value: any) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the vector contains an entry equal to `value`, otherwise `false`.

[[ `:copy() -> vec` ]]

    Returns a copy of the vector.

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of entries in the vector.

[[ `:filter(callback: func(any) -> bool) -> vec` ]]

    Returns a new vector created by mapping the function `callback` to each element of the vector in turn.
    `callback` should be a callable that takes a single argument (the vector element) and returns `true` or `false`;
    if it returns `true` the corresponding element will be added to the new vector.

[[ `:first() -> any` ]]

    Returns the first item from the vector without removing it.
    Panics if the vector is empty.

[[ `:get(index: i64) -> any` ]]

    Returns the value at `index`. Will panic if `index` is out of range or not an integer.

[[ `:index_of(value: any) -> i64|err` ]]

    Returns the index of the first occurrence of `value` in the vector.
    Returns an `err` if the vector does not contain `value`.

[[ `:insert_at(index: i64, value: any)` ]]

    Inserts `value` at the specified index.
    `index` must be less than or equal to the vector's item count.
    Panics if `index` is out of range.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the vector is empty.

[[ `:is_sorted() -> bool` <br> `:is_sorted(callback: func(any, any) -> bool) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the vector is sorted in ascending order.

    If a `callback` function is supplied it will be used to compare pairs of values.
    It should accept two arguments `a` and `b` and return `true` if `a < b`.

[[ `:iter() -> iter` ]]

    Returns an `iter` object wrapping the vector.

[[ `:join(sep: str) -> str` ]]

    Joins the vector's elements into a string, with each pair of elements separated by `sep`.
    Elements are automatically stringified --- this is equivalent to calling `$str()` on each element.

[[ `:last() -> any` ]]

    Returns the last item from the vector without removing it.
    Panics if the vector is empty.

[[ `:map(callback: func(any) -> any) -> vec` ]]

    Returns a new vector created by mapping the function `callback` to each element of the vector in turn.
    `callback` should be a callable that takes a single argument (the vector element);
    its return values will form the elements of the new vector.

[[ `:mergesort() -> vec` <br> `:mergesort(callback: func(any, any) -> bool) -> vec` ]]

    Sorts the vector in-place using a stable implementation of the mergesort algorithm.
    Returns the vector to allow chaining.

    If a `callback` function is supplied it will be used to compare pairs of values.
    It should accept two arguments `a` and `b` and return `true` if `a < b`.

[[ `:quicksort() -> vec` <br> `:quicksort(callback: func(any, any) -> bool) -> vec` ]]

    Sorts the vector in-place using the quicksort algorithm.
    Returns the vector to allow chaining.

    If a `callback` function is supplied it will be used to compare pairs of values.
    It should accept two arguments `a` and `b` and return `true` if `a < b`.

[[ `:remove_at(index: i64) -> any` ]]

    Removes and returns the value at the specified index.
    Panics if the index is out of range.

[[ `:remove_first() -> any` ]]

    Removes and returns the first item from the vector.
    Panics if the vector is empty.

[[ `:remove_last() -> any` ]]

    Removes and returns the last item from the vector.
    Panics if the vector is empty.

[[ `:reverse() -> vec` ]]

    Reverses the vector in-place. Returns the vector to enable chaining.

[[ `:set(index: i64, value: any)` ]]

    Sets the value at `index`. Will panic if `index` is out of range or not an integer.

[[ `:shuffle() -> vec` ]]

    Shuffles the vector in-place.
    Uses Fisher-Yates/Durstenfeld shuffling and random numbers from the `$std::prng` module.
    Returns the vector to enable chaining.

[[ `:slice(start_index: i64) -> vec` <br> `:slice(start_index: i64, length: i64) -> vec` ]]

    Copies a slice of the source vector and returns it as a new vector.
    The source vector is left unchanged.

    If `start_index` is negative, counts backwards from the end of the vector --- i.e. a `start_index` of `-1` refers to to the last item in the vector.

    If `length` is omitted, copies to the end of the source vector.

    Panics if either argument is out of range.

[[ `:sort() -> vec` <br> `:sort(callback: func(any, any) -> bool) -> vec` ]]

    Sorts the vector in-place using the default stable sorting algorithm (currently mergesort).
    Returns the vector to allow chaining.

    If a `callback` function is supplied it will be used to compare pairs of values.
    It should accept two arguments `a` and `b` and return `true` if `a < b`.



### Hash Maps

A hash map, `map`, is a collection of key-value pairs.
Pyro's map type preserves insertion order so when you iterate over a map you get its entries back in the same order you inserted them.

[[ `$map() -> map` ]]

    Creates a new `map` object.

Alternatively, you can create a map using literal syntax:

::: code pyro
    var map = {
        "foo" = 123,
        "bar" = 456,
    };

You can index into a map to get or set entries:

::: code pyro
    var value = map[key];
    var value = map:get(key);

    map[key] = value;
    map:set(key, value);

Indexing is equivalent to using the `:get()` and `:set()` methods as shown.

Maps are iterable:

::: code pyro
    for (key, value) in map:entries() {
        echo key;
        echo value;
    }

The `:entries()` method returns an iterator over key-value tuples which you can unpack in a for-loop as shown.
Maps also have a `:keys()` method which returns an iterator over the map's keys and a `:values()` method which returns an iterator over the map's values.

Maps have the following methods:

[[ `:contains(key: any) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the map contains `key`, otherwise `false`.

[[ `:copy() -> map` ]]

    Returns a copy of the map.

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of entries in the map.

[[ `:entries() -> iter[tup]` ]]

    Returns an iterator over `(key, value)` tuples.

[[ `:get(key: any) -> any` ]]

    Returns the value associated with `key` or `err` if `key` was not found.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the map is empty.

[[ `:keys() -> iter` ]]

    Returns an iterator over the map's keys.

[[ `:remove(key: any)` ]]

    Deletes the entry associated with `key` if it exists.

[[ `:set(key: any, value: any)` ]]

    Adds a new entry to the map or updates an existing entry.

[[ `:values() -> iter` ]]

    Returns an iterator over the map's values.



### Tuples

A tuple, `tup`, is an immutable array of values.

[[ `$tup() -> tup` <br> `$tup(arg1: any, arg2: any, ...) -> tup` ]]

    Creates a new `tup` object.
    The arguments provide the tuple's values.

You can index into a tuple to get (but not set) entries:

::: code pyro
    var value = tup[index];
    var value = tup:get(index);

Indices are zero-based. Indexing is equivalent to using the `:get()` method as shown.

Tuples are iterable:

::: code pyro
    for item in $tup(123, 456, 789) {
        echo item;
    }

Tuples have the following methods:

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of entries in the tuple.

[[ `:get(index: i64) -> any` ]]

    Returns the value at `index`. Will panic if `index` is out of range or not an integer.



### Errors

The error type, `err`, can be returned by functions to indicate failure.

[[ `$err() -> err` <br> `$err(arg1: any, arg2: any, ...) -> i64` ]]

    Creates a new `err` object.
    The arguments provide the error's values.

Errors are a specialized variant of tuples and support all the same methods and operations.

You can use the `$is_err(arg)` function to check if a value is an `err`.
Alternatively, you can use the error-coalescing operator `!!` to supply a default value for an operation that might fail:

::: code pyro
    var foo = might_fail() !! "default";



### Iterator Wrappers

The `iter` type can wrap any [iterator][1] to automatically add support for a set of chainable, lazily-evaluated utility methods.

[[ `$iter(arg: iterator|iterable) -> iter` ]]

   Wraps an iterator in an `iter` wrapper.
   The argument can be an iterator or an instance of an iterable type.

Iterators returned by Pyro builtins come pre-wrapped in `iter` wrappers, e.g. the character iterator returned by a string's `:chars()` method:

::: code pyro
    for char in "abcd":chars():enum() {
        echo char;
    }

The `:enum()` method is provided by the `iter` wrapper.
It adds an index to each element in the input, giving us the following output:

    (0, 'a')
    (1, 'b')
    (2, 'c')
    (3, 'd')

Iterator wrappers have the following methods:

[[ `:enum() -> iter[tup[i64, any]]` <br> `:enum(start_index: i64) -> iter[tup[i64, any]]` ]]

    Adds an enumeration wrapper to an iterator.
    Output values are two-item tuples containing an integer index and the original input value.
    `start_index` defaults to zero if not specified.

[[ `:filter(callback: func(any) -> bool) -> iter` ]]

    Returns a new `iter` instance that filters the output of the source iterator using the `callback` function.
    `callback` should be a callable that takes a single argument and returns a `bool`; input values will be passed through the filter if `callback` returns `true`.

[[ `:join(sep: str) -> str` ]]

    Joins the items returned by the iterator into a string, with each pair of items separated by `sep`.
    Items are automatically stringified --- this is equivalent to calling `$str()` on each item.

[[ `:map(callback: func(any) -> any) -> iter` ]]

    Returns a new `iter` instance mapping the function `callback` to the output of the source iterator.
    `callback` should be a callable that takes a single argument; its return values will form the output of the new iterator.

[[ `:skip_first(n: i64) -> iter` ]]

    Skips the first `n` items generated by the iterator.
    Panics if the iterator generates less than `n` items.

[[ `:skip_last(n: i64) -> iter` ]]

    Skips the last `n` items generated by the iterator.
    Panics if the iterator generates less than `n` items.

    Note that this method needs to buffer the iterator's full output to determine the end point.

[[ `:to_set() -> set` ]]

    Drains the iterator into a new set.

[[ `:to_vec() -> vec` ]]

    Drains the iterator into a new vector.



### Byte Buffers

A byte buffer, `buf`, is a dynamic array of bytes.

[[ `$buf() -> buf` <br> `$buf(content: str) -> buf` <br> `$buf(size: i64, fill_value: i64|char) -> buf` ]]

    Creates a new `buf` object.

    * If called with zero arguments, creates a new empty buffer.
    * If called with a single string argument, creates a new buffer containing a copy of the string's bytes.
    * If called with two arguments, creates a new buffer with the specified initial size and fill value, where `size` is a positive integer and `value` is an integer value in the range `[0, 255]`.

You can index into a buffer to get or set byte values:

::: code pyro
    var value = buf[index];
    var value = buf:get(index);

    buf[index] = value;
    buf:set(index, value);

Indices are zero-based. Indexing is equivalent to using the `:get()` and `:set()` methods as shown.

Buffers have the following methods:

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of bytes in the buffer.

[[ `:get(index: i64) -> i64` ]]

    Returns the byte value at `index` as an integer in the range `[0, 255]`.
    Will panic if `index` isn't an integer or is out of range.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the buffer is emtpy.

[[ `:set(index: i64, byte: i64)` ]]

    Sets the byte value at `index` to `byte` where `byte` is an integer in the range `[0, 255]`.
    Will panic if `index` isn't an integer or is out of range.
    Will panic if `byte` isn't an integer or is out of range.

[[ `:to_str() -> str` ]]

    Converts the content of the buffer into a string, leaving a valid but empty buffer object behind.
    Returns the new string.

    Writing to a buffer and then converting it to a string is an efficient way of assembling a long string from multiple parts as it avoids the cost of creating multiple temporary strings along the way.

    Note that calling `$str(buf)` on a buffer does something different --- it creates a string with a *copy* of the buffer's content, leaving the buffer itself unchanged.

[[ `:write(arg: any)` <br> `:write(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a string to the buffer.
    Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and writing the resulting string.
    Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and writing the resulting string.

    This method can panic if an error occurs while formatting the output string.

[[ `:write_byte(byte: i64)` ]]

    Appends `byte` to the buffer where `byte` is an integer in the range `[0, 255]`.
    Will panic if `byte` is not an integer or is out of range.



### Files

A file object, `file`, is a wrapper around a readable or writable byte stream.

[[ `$file(path: str, mode: str) -> file` ]]

    Creates a new `file` object.
    Opens the underlying file stream using the C function `fopen()`.
    Panics on failure.

Mode options:

::: table

    `"r"`   | Opens a file for reading. The file must exist.
    `"w"`   | Creates an empty file for writing. If the file already exists, its content will be erased.
    `"a"`   | Opens a file for appending. The file will be created if it does not exist.
    `"r+"`  | Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file must exist.
    `"w+"`  | Creates an empty file for both reading and writing. If the file already exists, its content will be erased.
    `"a+"`  | Opens a file for both reading and appending. The file will be created if it does not exist.

Files have the following methods:

[[ `:close()` ]]

    Closes the file stream.
    You can safely call `close()` on a file multiple times.
    If the file hasn't been explicitly closed it will be automatically closed by the garbage collector before the file object is destroyed.

[[ `:flush()` ]]

    Flushes the file stream.

[[ `:read() -> buf` ]]

    Reads the content of the file into a new byte buffer, `buf`.

    Returns the new buffer.
    Returns an empty buffer if the file was empty or if the end of the file had already been reached before the method was called.

    Panics if an I/O read error occurs or if sufficient memory cannot be allocated for the buffer.

[[ `:read_byte() -> i64?` ]]

    Reads the next byte value from the file.
    Returns the byte value as an integer in the range `[0, 255]`, or `null` if the end of the file had already been reached before the method was called.
    Panics if an I/O read error occurs.

[[ `:read_bytes(n: i64) -> buf?` ]]

    Attempts to read `n` bytes from the file into a new byte buffer.
    May read less than `n` bytes if the end of the file is reached first.

    Returns the new byte buffer or `null` if the end of the file had already been reached before the method was called.

    Panics if an I/O read error occurs, if the argument is invalid, or if sufficient memory cannot be allocated for the buffer.

[[ `:read_line() -> str?` ]]

    Reads the next line of input from the file and returns it as a string.
    Strips the terminating `\\n` or `\\r\\n` if present.

    Returns `null` if the end of the file had already been reached.

    Panics if an I/O read error occurs or if sufficient memory cannot be allocated for the string.

[[ `:read_string() -> str` ]]

    Reads the content of the file into a string, `str`.

    Returns the new string.
    Returns an empty string if the file was empty or if the end of the file had already been reached before the method was called.

    Panics if an I/O read error occurs or if sufficient memory cannot be allocated for the string.

[[ `:write(arg: any) -> i64` <br> `:write(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...) -> i64` ]]

    Writes a string or buffer to the file.

    If `arg` is a `buf`, its content will be written to the file directly.
    Otherwise, calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and writing the resulting string.
    Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and writing the resulting string.

    Returns the number of bytes written.

    Panics if an I/O write error occurs or if an error occurs while formatting the output string.

[[ `:write_byte(byte: i64)` ]]

    Writes a byte value to the file, where `byte` is an integer in the range `[0, 255]`.
    Panics if an I/O write error occurs or if the argument is an invalid type or is out of range.



### Stacks

A stack is a LIFO container type that supports only two operations --- *pushing* and *popping*.

[[ `$stack() -> stack` ]]

    Creates a new `stack` object.

Stacks have the following methods:

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of items in the stack.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the stack is empty.

[[ `:pop() -> any` ]]

    Pops and returns the value on top of the stack.
    Panics if the stack is empty.

[[ `:push(item: any)` ]]

    Pushes an item onto the stack.



### Queues

A queue is a FIFO container type that supports only two operations --- *enqueueing* and *dequeueing*.

[[ `$queue() -> queue` ]]

    Creates a new `queue` object.

Queues have the following methods:

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of items in the queue.

[[ `:dequeue() -> any` ]]

    Removes and returns the first item from the queue.
    Panics if the queue is empty.

[[ `:enqueue(item: any)` ]]

    Adds a new item to the end of the queue.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the queue is empty.



### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.

[[ `$set() -> set` <br> `$set(arg: iterable) -> set` ]]

    Creates a new `set` object.
    If `arg` is iterable, initializes the new set by iterating over its values.

Alternatively, you can create a set by draining an iterator, e.g.

::: code pyro
    var chars = "supercalifragilistic":chars():to_set();
    assert chars:count() == 12;

Sets have the following methods:

[[ `:add(item: any)` ]]

    Adds an item to the set.
    This is a null operation if the set already contains a member equal to `item`.

[[ `:contains(item: any) -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the set contains a member equal to `item`.

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of items in the set.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the set is empty.

[[ `:remove(item: any)` ]]

    Removes `item` from the set.
