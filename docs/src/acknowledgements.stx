I was inspired to build Pyro by reading Bob Nystrom's wonderful book [Crafting Interpreters][1], so many of the cleverest ideas in the implementation build on his work.

All code unique to Pyro is released under the [Zero-Clause BSD][0] (0BSD) license.

Code incorporated from external libraries and projects will be listed below.
(Pyro will only incorporate code released under permissive open source licenses --- e.g. MIT, BSD, or public domain.)

(*) The REPL uses the [Bestline][2] library by Justine Tunney to provide support for line-editing.
    This code was released under the 2-clause BSD license.

(*) Pyro's pseudo-random number generator uses the `xoshiro256**` algorithm by David Blackman and Sebastiano Vigna.
    The implementation is based on [code by the original authors][3] released into the public domain.

(*) The `std::pyro::path()` lookup uses the [whereami][4] library by Gr√©gory Pakosz.
    This code is dual-licensed under the MIT and WTFPLv2 licenses.
