A stack object, `stack`, is a LIFO (last-in-first-out) container type.

[[ `$stack() -> stack` ]]

    Creates a new `stack` object.

Stacks have the following methods:

[[ `:clear()` ]]

    Removes all items from the stack.

[[ `:count() -> i64` ]]

    Returns the number of items in the stack.

[[ `:is_empty() -> bool` ]]

    Returns `true` if the stack is empty.

[[ `:peek() -> any` ]]

    Returns the item on top of the stack without removing it.
    Returns an `err` if the stack is empty.

[[ `:pop() -> any` ]]

    Removes and returns the item on top of the stack.
    Returns an `err` if the stack is empty.

[[ `:push(item: any)` ]]

    Pushes an item onto the stack.
