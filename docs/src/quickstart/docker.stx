### Running the REPL

Run the pre-built Docker image:

::: code
    docker run --rm -it dmulholl/pyro:latest

Running the Docker image automatically runs its installed Pyro binary.

Running the Pyro binary without any arguments launches the REPL --- an interactive environment where you can run Pyro commands directly.

At the REPL prompt, type `echo "hello world";` and hit return:

::: code
    >>> echo "hello world";
    hello world

Pyro statements normally end with a semicolon, `;`, but you can omit the semicolon after typing a single statement in the REPL:

::: code
    >>> echo "hello world"
    hello world

Hit `Ctrl-D` or type `exit` and hit return to end the REPL session.



### Running a Script

Open a Bash shell in the pre-built Docker image:

::: code
    docker run --rm -it dmulholl/pyro:latest bash

You'll find a ready-made test file in the home directory:

::: code
    cat ./hello.pyro

It contains a simple Pyro script:

::: code pyro
    echo "hello world";

Run the script by supplying its filepath to the Pyro binary:

::: code
    pyro ./hello.pyro
    hello world

That's it, you can officially add Pyro to the list of languages on your CV.
Take the [tour](@root/tour//) if you'd like to learn more about the language.



### Installing Pyro Locally

You can find instructions for building and installing Pyro on your local system [here](@root/building//).
