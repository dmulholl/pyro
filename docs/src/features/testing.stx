Pyro has builtin support for unit tests using the `test` command:

    $ pyro test --help

    Usage: pyro test [files]

      This command runs unit tests. Each input file is
      executed in a new VM instance.

    Arguments:
      [files]              Files to test.

    Flags:
      -h, --help           Print this help text and exit.
      -v, --verbose        Show error output.

For each input file specified, Pyro first executes the file, then runs any test functions it contains, i.e. functions whose names begin with `$test_`. A test function passes if it executes without panicking.

You can use an `assert` statement to make a test function panic if the test fails, e.g.

::: code pyro
      def $test_addition() {
          assert 1 + 2 == 3;
      }

An `assert` statement passes if its operand expression evaluates as truthy or fails if it evaluates as falsey.

Note that test functions take no arguments.
