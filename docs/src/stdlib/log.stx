A simple logging library. Logging levels are, in order:

* `DEBUG`
* `INFO`
* `WARN`
* `ERROR`
* `FATAL`

A set of convenience functions are available for logging to the standard error stream.
Use a `Logger` instance to customize the output format and destination.



### Constants


[[ `DEBUG: i64` ]]

    Log-level `DEBUG`.

[[ `INFO: i64` ]]

    Log-level `INFO`.

[[ `WARN: i64` ]]

    Log-level `WARN`.

[[ `ERROR: i64` ]]

    Log-level `ERROR`.

[[ `FATAL: i64` ]]

    Log-level `FATAL`.



### Functions


[[ `debug(arg: any)` <br> `debug(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    A convenience function for writing a `DEBUG` log message to the standard error stream.

    * Calling this function with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this function with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `info(arg: any)` <br> `info(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    A convenience function for writing an `INFO` log message to the standard error stream.

    * Calling this function with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this function with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `warn(arg: any)` <br> `warn(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    A convenience function for writing a `WARN` log message to the standard error stream.

    * Calling this function with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this function with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `error(arg: any)` <br> `error(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    A convenience function for writing an `ERROR` log message to the standard error stream.

    * Calling this function with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this function with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `fatal(arg: any)` <br> `fatal(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    A convenience function for writing a `FATAL` log message to the standard error stream.

    This will cause the program to exit with a non-zero status code.

    * Calling this function with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this function with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.



### Classes

[[ `Logger() -> Logger` ]]

    Initializes a new `Logger` instance.

    * By default, a `Logger` logs to the standard error stream.
    * The default logging level is `INFO`.
    * The default timestamp format is `\[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]`.

`Logger` instances support the following methods:


[[ `:debug(arg: any)` <br> `:debug(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a `DEBUG` level log message to the logger's output file.

    * Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `:info(arg: any)` <br> `:info(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a `INFO` level log message to the logger's output file.

    * Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `:warn(arg: any)` <br> `:warn(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a `WARN` level log message to the logger's output file.

    * Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `:error(arg: any)` <br> `:error(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a `ERROR` level log message to the logger's output file.

    * Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `:fatal(arg: any)` <br> `:fatal(format_string: str, arg1: any, arg2: any, ...)` ]]

    Writes a `FATAL` level log message to the logger's output file.

    This will cause the program to exit with a non-zero status code.

    * Calling this method with a single argument is equivalent to calling `$str()` on that argument first and logging the resulting string.

    * Calling this method with more than one argument is equivalent to calling `$fmt()` on those arguments first and logging the resulting string.


[[ `:level(log_level: i64)` ]]

    Sets the logger's logging level.
    The default logging level is `INFO`.


[[ `:timestamp(format_string: str)` ]]

    Sets the logger's timestamp format string.
    The default format string is `"\[%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]"`.

    The format string can include any format specifiers supported by the C standard library's `strftime()` function.


[[ `:file(output_file: file)` ]]

    Sets the logger's output file.
    The default output file is the standard error stream.
