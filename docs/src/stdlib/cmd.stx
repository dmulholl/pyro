Convenience functions for running common system binaries.

* The directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable will be searched for the named binaries.

* Arguments are passed directly to the binary and don't need to be shell-escaped.



### Functions


[[ `cp(src: str, dst: str)` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `cp` command as:

    ::: code
        cp -rf <src> <dst>

    Panics if the `cp` binary cannot be found or if it exits with a non-zero status code.



[[ `git(*args: str) -> str` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `git` command with the specified arguments.

    Returns the `git` command's standard output as a string.

    Panics if the `git` binary cannot be found or if it exits with a non-zero status code.



[[ `make(*args: str) -> str` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `make` command with the specified arguments.

    Returns the `make` command's standard output as a string.

    Panics if the `make` binary cannot be found or if it exits with a non-zero status code.



[[ `mkdir(path: str)` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `mkdir` command as:

    ::: code
        mkdir -p <path>

    Panics if the `mkdir` binary cannot be found or if it exits with a non-zero status code.



[[ `mv(src: str, dst: str)` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `mv` command as:

    ::: code
        mv -f <src> <dst>

    Panics if the `mv` binary cannot be found or if it exits with a non-zero status code.



[[ `rm(path: str)` ]]

    Equivalent to running the `rm` command as:

    ::: code
